# My Portfolio

## About Me
I am a **web developer** currently enrolled at TripleTen and an **aspiring game developer**. I have a passion for creating interactive experiences and learning new technologies.

## Web Development Skills
- **HTML/CSS**: Building and styling web pages
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to web applications
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **VSCode**: Code editor of choice
- **Figma**: UI/UX design tool

## Game Development Skills

- **Pixel Art**: The art page is on its way. I also have a mood board page 

## EXISTING PROJECTS
#### Web Development with TripleTen
- [Spots](#): A social media image sharing website. Edit your profile and add/remove photos.
- [Coffee Shop](#): A landing page for a coffee shop. 

#### Game Development
- [Cody Chameleon](#): You are a color changing lizard just trying to stay away from scary creatures and moving platforms. 

## Future Projects
#### Web Development
- A "mood board" for game designers where they can easily communicate concepts and "vibes" to collaborate with artists and build a community. Pictures and music will be the primary function. A 3D model viewer would be a nice challenge to implement. A robust GDD (Game Design Document) display will help your team and your community hold you accountable to your projects.

#### Game Development
- [Red Orbit](#): You and your crew are stranded accross several moons vibrant with exotic environments and life. You discover the moons are interconnected by a portal system made by an ancient civilization, once a hub for the galaxy. It's original engineers, the Xyntarians, have lost knowledge of its operation due to amnesia and catastrophe. You find yourself responsible for saving your crew as well as the lunar civilizations that orbit Matrima.
