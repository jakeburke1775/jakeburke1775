## About Me
I am a **web developer** currently enrolled at TripleTen. I am also a **hobbyist game developer**. I have a passion for creating interactive experiences and learning new technologies.

## Web Development Skills
- **HTML/CSS**: Building and styling web pages
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to web applications
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **VSCode**: Code editor of choice
- **Figma**: UI/UX design tool

## Game Development Skills
- **GML (GameMaker Language)**: Developing games with a pinch of experience
- **Pixel Art**: The art page is on its way. I also have a mood board page idea you can read about below.

## EXISTING PROJECTS
#### Web Development with TripleTen
- [Spots](#): A social media image sharing website. Edit your profile and add/remove photos.
- [Coffee Shop](#): A landing page for a coffee shop. 

#### Game Development
- [Cody Chameleon](#): You are a color changing lizard just trying to stay away from scary creatures and moving platforms. 

## Future Projects
#### Web Development

- A portfolio and interactive resume page for future employers is a must. It will showcase my TripleTen projects and outline future projects.
  
- A "mood board" for game designers where they can easily communicate concepts and "vibes" to collaborate with artists and build a community. Pictures and music will be the primary function. A 3D model viewer would be a nice challenge to implement. A robust GDD (Game Design Document) display will help your team and your community hold you accountable to your projects.

- A store where you can both make a QR code for your website, github, linkedin, social media, etc.. and get a shirt made out of it to get peoples' attention. Imagine a shirt with no context but a QR code with a github icon in the middle. You'd be sure capture the attention of software engineers and get the conversation going. Maybe you're a hot IG influencer; Same concept.

- A new construction management tool: BuildPro, the competition, is used by top builders like DR Horton and Lennar. It aims to automate construction management but falls short due to outdated systems and heavy user input requirements. With nearly a decade of experience using it, I believe a modern replacement could transform the real estate market. Builders currently manage 15-40 homes, but with AI, improved server management, and integrated email systems, they could manage 90-140 homes, with top performers handling over 200. This change could save companies millions, create new blue-collar and software jobs, and significantly improve efficiency.

#### Game Development
- [Red Orbit](#): You and your crew are stranded accross several moons vibrant with exotic environments and life. You discover the moons are interconnected by a portal system made by an ancient civilization, once a hub for the galaxy. It's original engineers, the Xyntarians, have lost knowledge of its operation due to amnesia and catastrophe. You find yourself responsible for saving your crew as well as the lunar civilizations that orbit Matrima.
