# My Portfolio

## About Me
I am a **web developer** currently enrolled at TripleTen. I am also a **hobbyist game developer**. I have a passion for creating interactive experiences and learning new technologies.

## Web Development Skills
- **HTML/CSS**: Building and styling web pages
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to web applications
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **VSCode**: Code editor of choice
- **Figma**: UI/UX design tool

## Game Development Skills
- **GML (GameMaker Language)**: Developing games with a pinch of experience
- **Pixel Art**: The art page is on its way. I also have a mood board page idea you can read about below.

## EXISTING PROJECTS
#### Web Development with TripleTen
- [Spots](#): A social media image sharing website. Edit your profile and add/remove photos.
- [Coffee Shop](#): A landing page for a coffee shop. 

#### Game Development
- [Cody Chameleon](#): You are a color changing lizard just trying to stay away from scary creatures and moving platforms. 

## Future Projects
#### Web Development

- A portfolio and interactive resume page for future employers is a must. It will showcase my TripleTen projects and outline future projects.
  
- A "mood board" for game designers where they can easily communicate concepts and "vibes" to collaborate with artists and build a community. Pictures and music will be the primary function. A 3D model viewer would be a nice challenge to implement. A robust GDD (Game Design Document) display will help your team and your community hold you accountable to your projects.

- A store where you can both make a QR code for your website, github, linkedin, social media, etc.. and get a shirt made out of it to get peoples' attention. Imagine a shirt with no context but a QR code with a github icon in the middle. You'd be sure capture the attention of software engineers and get the conversation going. Maybe you're a hot IG influencer; Same concept.

- - A new construction management tool: BuildPro (by Hyphen) is a platform use by homebuilding titans like DR Horton, Lennar, Pulte and Meritage. The builders use it to manage subcontractors and their tasks, with the ability to add and keep track of repairs. I have extensive experience with this platform as the end user and it is nothing short of garbage. It's purpose is to automate, but requires heavy input from the user. It is outdated and the way it manages information is elementary. A replacement is not only needed, but could completely change the real-estate market. What one builder can manage is at the mercy of BuildPro's function.
  With nearly a decade of experience using this platform, I am confident its outdated system is holding the industry back. Currently, a builder can manage 15-30 homes or units, while top-performing builders can handle 30-40 homes. By improving server management, logic, email systems, and incorporating AI (technologies that are already available), an average builder could manage 90-140 homes. Higher performing builders, using the most ideal format of this idea, could manage over 200. This is not a fantasy. 
  With a powerful (and fast) enough platform, a builder's day-to-day will only be inputting a series of job-specific promts, where an AI assistant takes the reigns: Sending follow up emails that are professional, but escalate infractions to the right channels will take a lot of emailing out of the builders' hands. Keeping track of trades that frequently no-show, don't respond, etc. will give procurement teams an upper hand. One of the biggest benefits to the companies that will use this newer system is that they will save millions every year not having to satisfy as many 6-figure salaries. The efficiency will, however, put a lot more blue collar jobs on the table as well as software engineering jobs for the application developer. It has been my dream to pioneer this idea since I started my career in construction.

#### Game Development
- [Red Orbit](#): You and your crew are stranded accross several moons vibrant with exotic environments and life. You discover the moons are interconnected by a portal system made by an ancient civilization, once a hub for the galaxy. It's original engineers, the Xyntarians, have lost knowledge of its operation due to amnesia and catastrophe. You find yourself responsible for saving your crew as well as the lunar civilizations that orbit Matrima.
